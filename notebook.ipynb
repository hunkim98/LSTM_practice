      "A system, method, and software product provide an efficient mechanism for rendering characters for computer based animation. The operation of the system is particularly well suited to the rendering of scenes of large numbers of characters, such as scenes of large crowds. The system uses a stroke based character model for a character, which is a collection of strokes, defined in a three dimensional coordinate system of a character, and associated with a geometric model of the character. This stroke model of the character and its association to the geometric model enables the strokes to move or change position over time as the character moves. The stroke model reduces the amount of data needed to accurately represent the character, particularly its shadows and silhouettes. Using the stroke models for many instances of characters within a frame or sequence of frames of animation, the system determines the positions of the characters in a global coordinate system in the frame, and then determines the respective positions of the stroke models of the characters, also in the global coordinate system. This collection of strokes is then input into a renderer, along with a camera model and a lighting model in order to render a final image of a frame or frame sequence. A preferred renderer is a particle renderer which draws each stroke through a series of control points which define the stroke.\n",

      "A nominal carriage velocity profile is initiated during each carriage positioning interval which enables the carriage to be decelerated and stopped at the proper position for printing. However, the carriage velocity profile can be modified during the positioning interval to avoid decelerating if printing can occur on the fly; i.e., if the print element (and ribbon) are able to complete any necessary positioning by the time the carriage arrives at its printing position. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the slave microprocessor produces a READY signal in advance of the print wheel arriving at its destination orientation. The READY signal indicates that both the print wheel and ribbon will reach their destinations and be ready for printing within a fixed time interval; e.g., three milliseconds. In response to the READY signal, the master microprocessor inhibits further adjustments in the carriage speed and permits the carriage to assume a \"fly\" mode. Additionally, from known carriage position and velocity information, the master microprocessor determines the time at which the carriage will pass through the printing position and when the hammer is to be fired.\n",

      "The print convention apparatus and method disclosed herein effects a decision making process with respect to a determination as to whether an alphabetic character field output from an optical character reader (OCR) is related to the OCR scan of an upper case or a lower case inscription on the document scanned. The alphabetic character field (e.g., a word) is comprised of one or a series of alphabetic characters which represent the OCR's interpretation of characters printed on the scanned document. Each word output by the OCR corresponds to a field (i.e., word) of characters imprinted on the scanned document. The electrical signals representative of the upper and lower case alphabetic characters and rejects including conflicts outputted from the OCR are applied to a character occurrence probability storage apparatus which contains precomputed empirical probabilities therein that: (1) a given character recognition is the result of the scan of an upper case character; and (2) a given character recognition is the result of the scan of a lower case character. In addition, the storage apparatus includes probability values for character conflicts and rejects. As the series of alphabetic character signals from the OCR output are applied character-by-character to the character occurrence probability storage apparatus (e.g., a read-only store), a running sum of the respective probabilities for the upper case and lower case print conventions is developed so that, following the input of the final character, reject or conflict within a word to the aforesaid apparatus, an appropriate upper or lower case determination can be made for all of the characters within the word. This determination corresponds with the print convention of the word inscribed on the scanned document. A corresponding upper or lower case flag is correspondingly generated with the print convention determination, and associated with the alphabetic character word output from the print convention apparatus for further text processing. In one embodiment of the invention the probability for each OCR output alphabetic character being an upper or lower case character is stored in respective upper and lower case character occurrence probability storage devices after having been precomputed as the product of two probability factors; i.e., (1) a first probability factor with respect to the likelihood that the OCR recognition resulted from the scan of an upper or lower case character, and (2) a second probability factor with respect to the likelihood of a given character occurring in a specified language (e.g., English) document. In another embodiment of the invention, the character occurrence probability storage devices are functionally replaced by a read-only store having an address position for each upper and lower case alphabetic character outputted by the OCR including conflicts and rejects, and a precomputed numerical probability value associated with each address position to represent the quotient of: (1) the probability that a given character is related to an upper case print convention; and (2) the probability that the same character is related to a lower case print convention.\n",

      "This disclosure concerns a system for automatically reading handwritten and typewritten characters. First, a 64.times.64 point image is made of each character. Then the size and any overlapping with an adjacent character is considered in determining whether the character is either handwritten or typewritten, the latter being smaller and not overlapping. To consider these properties, the image on the 64.times.64 point image area is moved into the upper lefthand corner of the area so that its top and lefthand edge of the image are in contact with the top and lefthand edge of the area for better determining the size of the image after overlapping, if any, has been eliminated. Next, each of the images on the 64.times.64 point image areas, is separated into four images having 32.times.32 image points which are stored in four separate registers. The four 32.times.32 point images correspond with each of the four points making up each square of four image points of the original 64.times.64 point image, which squares of four image points are homogeneously distributed over the total 64.times.64 point image area. By selecting successively or simultaneously the corresponding image points stored in one or more of these 32.times.32 point image stores or registers, each character can be enhanced, enlarged, sharpened, or widened so as to be better readable. The final detection of the character is made by comparison with separate learning means for the clasified typewritten and handwritten characters.\n",

      "The present invention is a method and apparatus for watermarking text or vector graphics documents. It is based on character-wise or vector graphics element-wise grayscale or color modulation. At high resolution, halftone or dither modulation can also be used in addition or in place of grayscale/color modulation, for printed representation of electronic document. For the detection, the document is acquired through an acquisition device, document segmentation is performed, characters/elements are segmented, the watermark signal is estimated and the information is decoded. Although the proposed scheme mostly addresses the watermarking of hard-copy documents, it can easily be integrated into electronic document editing and acquisition tools, and the watermark is attached to the document electronic version.The invention is applicable either using expensive high-resolution printing and acquisition devices, either using common cheap low-resolution devices, depending on the application needs. The proposed scheme is suitable for example to the protection of security documents, contracts, technical and commercial documentation; it can use any physical support like paper, cellulose, or plastic; it can be used for copy protection, authentication, or tamper proofing; finally it can also be applied to other non security-related applications, such as document tracking, as well as document embedded annotation and watermarked-assisted automatic processing.\n",
      "An electrical circuit is described that requires a reduced number of data bits for character-address and video-mode information by using a predetermined bit combination of the video-mode information as part of the character-address information. Character-address and video-mode information is output from a random access memory (RAM) to a character read only memory (ROM) and a video-mode detection circuit that produces outputs to enable video-mode circuits in the video control circuitry. One output of the video-mode detection circuit is coupled to an address input of the character ROM that has characters divided into two character sets. A predetermined bit combination of the video-mode information produces an output from the video-mode detection circuit that selects one of the character sets while the other bit combinations produce an output from the detection circuit that selects the other character set. In this way, character-address and video-mode information having n data bits can produce character and video-mode outputs that normally require n+1 data bits.\n",

      "A character animation system, method, and computer program product for animating a skeleton. The skeleton has bones arranged in a hierarchy. Each bone in the skeleton is defined in relation to its parent bone and the topmost bone in the hierarchy is the root bone. When a bone in the skeleton is animated, all of the bones below the animated bone in the hierarchy are also animated. An animation for a bone is specified using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) having one or more nodes. The nodes are either data generation nodes (DG nodes) or combiner nodes. DG nodes have zero or one input and have one output that outputs animation data. DG nodes having zero inputs include fixed, pre-generated, tracking, reverse, mirror, and noise nodes. DG nodes having one input include limit and reflect nodes. Combiner nodes have two inputs for receiving animation data and one output that outputs animation data.

The character generator is coupled to an input source which periodically generates a character address signal representative of a selected character. A read only memory contains a plurality of multi-byte microprograms each located at a predetermined address. Twelve eight-bit bytes constitute a single microprogram which defines a single character.

      "A method of, and system for, increasing the number of characters available to be printed with a single print element. If a printer is printing from storage and the character being presented to the printer does not match the print element in use, a determination is made as to whether the character is in fact available on the element. If so, the character is caused to be printed. If not, a determination is made as to whether the presented character can be constructed from characters existing on the print element.

      "Character recognition method and system that identifies an input character as being a unique member of a defined character set. Specifically, a character bit-map of an input character is first generated. Thereafter, a character recognition procedure processes the character bit-map to generate a set of confidence measures one for each of the members of the character set.

Method using complementary character coding, a new approach to character level dynamic tainting, which allows efficient and precise taint propagation across the boundaries of server components, and also between servers and clients over HTTP.

The control means then assigns every light-emitting element an individual actuation time and stores this in a switching time memory. Upon actuation, every light-emitting element thus supplies the same radiant energy to the recording medium.\n",

      "Computer generated (CG) hair for a virtual character can include strand-based (instanced) hair in which many thousands of digital strands represent real human hair strands. Strand-based hair can appear highly realistic, but rendering strand-based hair in real-time presents challenges. Techniques for generating textured polygon strip (poly strip) hair for a virtual character can use as an input previously-generated strand-based hair for the virtual character. Poly strips can be generated for a sampled set of strands in the strand-based hair. Additional poly strips may be generated near hairlines or part lines. Hair textures from a hair texture library can be matched to the poly strips. The matched textures can be scaled and packed into a region of texture space (e.g., a square region), which provides improved computer access, efficiency, and speed. A rendering engine can use the poly strips and the packed hair textures to render the character's hair in real-time.\n",

      "Host multiple-byte character generator processing of guest keyboard events is blocked during applications sharing. A guest keyboard driver generates guest keyboard events which may be processed by any guest multiple-byte character generator. The guest events are transmitted to a host for use in shared applications. A patch instruction is written over a host storage queue which causes a jump to a patch subroutine when an attempt is made to deposit host keyboard events in the storage queue. Host keyboard events are marked by the patch subroutine and the marked host events are deposited in a shadow queue which is disposed in parallel with the host storage queue. Guest events also are deposited in the shadow queue. Untranslated host and single-byte character guest events, are stored in the host storage queue. When a shared application requires data from the host storage queue, the outgoing event is examined for origin, such as by examining the shadow queue. If the event is a guest event, a call is made to a host-executed applications sharing program, which in turn calls the host-multiple character generator. The call to the host multiple-byte character generator bypasses execution of the generator to preventing it from processing guest events prior to their entry into the shared application. In an embodiment of the invention, if the guest transmits a multiple-byte character to the host, the host-executed applications sharing system calls a host operating system module responsible for entering the guest multiple-byte character into a shared application. The guest multiple-byte character is entered into the shared application without a call being made to the host multiple-byte character generator.\n",

Unambiguous parts of a cursive image, referred to as \"key characters,\" are identified. If the level of confidence that a segment of a line of cursive text is a particular character is higher than a threshold, and is also sufficiently higher than the level of confidence of neighboring segments, then the character is designated as a key character candidate. Key character candidates are then screened using geometric information. The key character candidates that pass the screening are designated key characters.

The first stage of lexicon reduction uses a neural network to estimate a lower bound and an upper bound of the number of characters in a line of cursive text. Lexicon entries having a total number of characters outside of the bounds are eliminated. For the second stage of lexicon reduction, the lexicon is further reduced by comparing character strings using the key characters, with lexicon entries. For each of the key characters in the character strings, it is determined whether there is a mismatch between the key character and characters in a corresponding search range in the lexicon entry.

      "A handwriting recognition system is described that includes a language model with scoring to improve recognition accuracy, such as for words outside of a selected language model. The handwriting recognition system increases the accuracy of handwriting recognizers that perform segmentation of ink into atomic elements (segments) and then classify each ink segment separately. After segmentation, a shape classifier estimates the class (letter) probabilities for each segment of ink by producing a corresponding score. The system applies the language model scoring to the shape classification results and typically selects the class with the highest score as the recognition result. Because the language model is not too restrictive, it works well for recognizing any word, even those that would not be in a dictionary for the current language. Thus, the handwriting recognition system produces better recognition results and can often recognize words that dictionary-based language models would not recognize correctly.\n",

In the process according to the invention, lines are located by expanding or contracting the original image of the cipher to fit into a sparse space pixel matrix. The image is then thinned to define lines and so as not to obliterate lines which give the cipher its uniqueness. Once the cipher is thinned, fuzzy logic is used to \"locate\", that is, define a set of coordinates for, each line relative to an x-y coordinate system. (As each line is located, it is removed from the matrix image to facilitate locating the remaining lines.) After all the lines are located, the endpoints of each line are located and the intersect points are located. These three feature sets are encoded, resulting in three values, such as 64-bit integers. These three integers are then used as search keys to query a relational database which contains the integer sets for known characters. If a direct match is not found, a matching algorithm uses partial matches to extrapolate the correct character.

      "An optical scanning system operates asynchronously by electro-optically detecting movement of a scanning unit directly from the data being scanned. A first embodiment of the system includes two sets of optical sensors in a hand-held unit. One set extends transversely of a scanning direction for detecting the optical pattern, and a second set is approximately aligned with the scanning direction for detecting relative movement between the pattern and the scanning unit. Relative movement is detected by detecting a pattern in a first subset of the second set of sensors and then sensing a shift of the detected pattern to a second subset of the second set of sensors. In response to detecting a unit movement, the optical states of the first set of sensor elements are polled to record a portion of the pattern along the line. This response is preferably triggered indirectly by calculating an average time interval between relative movements and periodically polling the first set of sensors at a rate set by this average interval. Upon detecting a uniform optical state of the second set of sensors, such as when scanning across a blank region in the pattern, sensing of the optical state of the first sensors continues at periodic intervals so long as the uniform state continues to be detected.

      "The invention provides an optical character reader (OCR) utilizing prioritized horizontal OR ranges for enhanced accuracy and ease of use. A light source illuminates a price tag or the like on which characters have been imprinted generally along a horizontal direction of the sheet. A lens system images the characters onto an image sensor having a field of vision covering a plurality of characters, the image sensor including a plurality of photo-electric conversion elements arranged in a matrix. A binary coding circuit digitizes outputs of the photo-electric conversion elements, which define picture elements (pixels), of an image in the field of vision of the image sensor, into binary signals representing black and white picture elements. A hand holdable scanner incorporates the light source, image sensor, lens system and binary coding circuit. An identifying circuit identifies characters from binary-coded data. The OCR utilizes at least two horizontal OR ranges in the field of vision of the image sensor. When the horizontal OR range of higher priority detects a character line, the result of character line detection is output. When none of the horizontal OR ranges detects a character line, it is determined that there is no character line. The character line detecting operation of each of the horizontal OR ranges is the same as that in the conventional OCR. However, in the OCR according to the present invention, the horizontal OR ranges are spread horizontally. Therefore, even in the case of a price tag which is long enough to have characters arranged along one of its sides, the character line or lines can be positively detected. Since at least two horizontal OR ranges are provided in the field of vision of the image sensor, therefore the pattern of the background of the price tag and the characters on the price tag can be distinguished from each other. This means that the OCR can be used for relatively small in size price tags. The OCR conserves electric power when it is not actively \"reading\" data by suspending its character identifying operations when not needed. Lines having no characters are identified and, in response, character identifying operations are stopped.\n",

      "Wrinkles are produced by computing directional stress, whether compression or stretching, for each pixel within each face of the mesh representing the skin, and then perturbing a surface normal based on the computed stress at each pixel in that face of the mesh. Directional stress at a given frame in an animation is determined, in general, by comparing the current state of the mesh at that frame (called a “current pose”) to the original state of the mesh (called a “rest pose”). An artist specifies a wrinkle pattern by defining a texture that is mapped to the surface, using conventional techniques. A gradient texture is created from this wrinkle texture by computing the gradient at each pixel in the wrinkle texture. For each location in a face of the surface, the vector from the gradient texture is mapped to the corresponding face of the rest pose skin model and the current pose skin model, to produce two surface vectors. These two vectors are compared to provide an estimate of the surface stress at this location in the face. A wrinkle effect may be implemented using bump mapping, but the surface normal is perturbed differently for each location in the face of the mesh based on the skin stress estimated at that location. Other effects also may be created using the estimated stresses.\n",

      "In the serializer for converting parallel data into serial data, where the parallel data comprises normal characters all of the same length and a last character of a different length, the characters are each tagged by an extra bit as it enters a FIFO. This tag bit indicates the length of the character and is shifted along with the character as the character is shifted through the FIFO. The normal character length and the length of the last character are stored. As a character emerges from the FIFO, its tag bit identifies it as a normal character or as the last character. Such tag bit is used to select the correct character length in a counter. The character is loaded in a shifter which is controlled by the counter. Therefore, the shifter is controlled by the counter to shift the correct number of times in order to shift the character into a serial bit stream. Since each character carries along with it a bit which indicates its character length, the CPU is not called upon to intervene in a time critical manner to change the character length in the counter in order to correctly control the shifting of the shifter. Hence messages of arbitrary bit length can be transmitted without the normal CPU intervention at the end of the message.\n",

      "A text comparator receives data stored in a mass storage device. The text comparator includes word logic, delimiter logic, set logic, set combination logic, proximity logic, and programming logic. The delimiter logic serves to monitor the characters transferred from the mass storage device and provides discrete signals depicting whether the character being transferred is a predefined delimiter character. The word logic serves to store data regarding predefined words (i.e., strings of characters) which are to be located and provides output word signals indicating when such predefined words have been located. The set logic receives the delimiter signals and word signals and provides output signals when selected words are located in the same sentence, same paragraph, etc., as desired. The set combination logic serves to combine the signals from the set logic in order to generate output signals in response to more complex search strategies than can be easily detected by the set logic. The proximity logic provides output signals indicating when predefined words detected by word logic or predefined set of words, as detected by set logic or a combination of this information, occurs within a predefined proximity. For example, proximity logic will determine if a first selected word occurs within N (where N is a selected integer) words of a second preselected word. The programming logic serves to receive search strategy instructions from the user and in response thereto provide the proper timing, addressing, and data signals the word logic, delimiter logic, set logic, set combination logic, and proximity logic to cause to be stored within these elements the information required to perform the desired search strategy.\n",

      "A method for operating a machine to perform unsupervised training of a set of character templates uses as the source of training samples an image source of character images, called glyphs, that need not be manually or automatically segmented or isolated prior to training. A recognition operation performed on the image source of character images produces a labeled glyph position data structure that includes, for each glyph in the image source, a glyph image position in the image source associating an estimated image location of the glyph in the image source with a character label paired with the glyph image position that indicates the character in the character set being trained. The labeled glyph position data and the image source are then used to determine sample image regions in the image source; each sample image region is large enough to contain at least a single glyph but need not be restricted in size to only contain a single glyph. The template construction process using unsegmented samples is mathematically modeled as an optimization problem that optimizes a function that represents the set of character templates being trained as an ideal image to be reconstructed to match the input image. The method produces all of the character templates substantially contemporaneously by using a novel pixel scoring technique that implements an approximation of a maximum likelihood criterion subject to a constraint on the templates produced which holds that foreground pixels in adjacently positioned character images have substantially nonoverlapping foreground pixels.

      "The aesthetic characteristics of adjacent characters are used to enhance the quality of output in a proportional spacing printer and to provide right margin justification for composing. Spacing between characters is determined on the basis of the character being printed and the preceding character already printed on the page. An intercharacter displacement memory contains a list of ideal spacing for all combinations of characters to be printed. As each character is typed, it and the previously stored preceding character address the intercharacter displacement memory. The output of the intercharacter displacement memory is the ideal value of escapement for this combination of characters and font style. The printer positions the print head prior to printing the next character, rather than positioning the print head after the previous character is printed. Line ending decisions for composing are eliminated during initial and final typing of a document by adding to the intercharacter displacement memory recommendations for altering the ideal spacing between characters, where aesthetically possible, to eliminate the need for line ending hyphenation.

      "Font-independent spotting of user-defined keywords in a scanned image. Word identification is based on features of the entire word without the need for segmentation or OCR, and without the need to recognize non-keywords. Font-independent character models are created using hidden Markov models (HMMs) and arbitrary keyword models are built from the character HMM components. Word or text line bounding boxes are extracted from the image, a set of features based on the word shape, (and preferably also the word internal structure) within each bounding box is extracted, this set of features is applied to a network that includes one or more keyword HMMs, and a determination is made. The identification of word bounding boxes for potential keywords includes the steps of reducing the image (say by 2x) and subjecting the reduced image to vertical and horizontal morphological closing operations. The bounding boxes of connected components in the resulting image are then used to hypothesize word or text line bounding boxes, and the original bitmaps within the boxes are used to hypothesize words. In a particular embodiment, a range of structuring elements is used for the closing operations to accommodate the variation of inter- and intra-character spacing with font and font size.\n",
