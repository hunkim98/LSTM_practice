"A system, method, and software product provide an efficient mechanism for rendering characters for computer based animation. The operation of the system is particularly well suited to the rendering of scenes of large numbers of characters, such as scenes of large crowds. The system uses a stroke based character model for a character, which is a collection of strokes, defined in a three dimensional coordinate system of a character, and associated with a geometric model of the character. This stroke model of the character and its association to the geometric model enables the strokes to move or change position over time as the character moves. The stroke model reduces the amount of data needed to accurately represent the character, particularly its shadows and silhouettes. Using the stroke models for many instances of characters within a frame or sequence of frames of animation, the system determines the positions of the characters in a global coordinate system in the frame, and then determines the respective positions of the stroke models of the characters, also in the global coordinate system. This collection of strokes is then input into a renderer, along with a camera model and a lighting model in order to render a final image of a frame or frame sequence. A preferred renderer is a particle renderer which draws each stroke through a series of control points which define the stroke.",2001-12-04,A,6326972,3D stroke-based character modeling suitable for efficiently rendering large crowds,2001

"A nominal carriage velocity profile is initiated during each carriage positioning interval which enables the carriage to be decelerated and stopped at the proper position for printing. However, the carriage velocity profile can be modified during the positioning interval to avoid decelerating if printing can occur on the fly; i.e., if the print element (and ribbon) are able to complete any necessary positioning by the time the carriage arrives at its printing position. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the slave microprocessor produces a READY signal in advance of the print wheel arriving at its destination orientation. The READY signal indicates that both the print wheel and ribbon will reach their destinations and be ready for printing within a fixed time interval; e.g., three milliseconds. In response to the READY signal, the master microprocessor inhibits further adjustments in the carriage speed and permits the carriage to assume a ""fly"" mode. Additionally, from known carriage position and velocity information, the master microprocessor determines the time at which the carriage will pass through the printing position and when the hammer is to be fired.",1987-03-31,A,4653946,Adaptive electronic control system for formed character printer,1987

"The print convention apparatus and method disclosed herein effects a decision making process with respect to a determination as to whether an alphabetic character field output from an optical character reader (OCR) is related to the OCR scan of an upper case or a lower case inscription on the document scanned. The alphabetic character field (e.g., a word) is comprised of one or a series of alphabetic characters which represent the OCR's interpretation of characters printed on the scanned document. Each word output by the OCR corresponds to a field (i.e., word) of characters imprinted on the scanned document. The electrical signals representative of the upper and lower case alphabetic characters and rejects including conflicts outputted from the OCR are applied to a character occurrence probability storage apparatus which contains precomputed empirical probabilities therein that: (1) a given character recognition is the result of the scan of an upper case character; and (2) a given character recognition is the result of the scan of a lower case character. In addition, the storage apparatus includes probability values for character conflicts and rejects. As the series of alphabetic character signals from the OCR output are applied character-by-character to the character occurrence probability storage apparatus (e.g., a read-only store), a running sum of the respective probabilities for the upper case and lower case print conventions is developed so that, following the input of the final character, reject or conflict within a word to the aforesaid apparatus, an appropriate upper or lower case determination can be made for all of the characters within the word. This determination corresponds with the print convention of the word inscribed on the scanned document. A corresponding upper or lower case flag is correspondingly generated with the print convention determination, and associated with the alphabetic character word output from the print convention apparatus for further text processing. In one embodiment of the invention the probability for each OCR output alphabetic character being an upper or lower case character is stored in respective upper and lower case character occurrence probability storage devices after having been precomputed as the product of two probability factors; i.e., (1) a first probability factor with respect to the likelihood that the OCR recognition resulted from the scan of an upper or lower case character, and (2) a second probability factor with respect to the likelihood of a given character occurring in a specified language (e.g., English) document. In another embodiment of the invention, the character occurrence probability storage devices are functionally replaced by a read-only store having an address position for each upper and lower case alphabetic character outputted by the OCR including conflicts and rejects, and a precomputed numerical probability value associated with each address position to represent the quotient of: (1) the probability that a given character is related to an upper case print convention; and (2) the probability that the same character is related to a lower case print convention.",1977-01-11,A,4003025,Alphabetic character word upper/lower case print convention apparatus and method,1977

"When a character image composed of strokes is generated, character generation is performed at high speed by simplifying strokes for which the processing of the stroke contours can be executed in simple fashion. In other words, if a stroke has a substantially linear shape parallel to a coordinate axis, the contour of the stroke will have sides parallel to the coordinate axis and can therefore be generated in a simple manner.

That is, memory cells having successive addresses usually are allocated along the direction of the scanning lines. Accordingly, when necessary a stroke is rotated in such a manner that the longitudinal direction thereof becomes parallel to the raster lines, thereby producing a stroke.

"A character generator produces highly accurate electronic reproductions of characters of any chosen style on the screen of a CRT by simultaneously controlling the orientation, length and intensity of the strokes formed by the electron beam of the CRT. The character generator is coupled to an input source which periodically generates a character address signal representative of a selected character.

"A data structure for specifying the types of constants whose character values are to be converted to Unicode; for specifying which code page or pages are used for specifying the character encodings used in the source program for writing the character strings to be converted to Unicode; and that can be used to perform conversions from SBCS, mixed SBCS/DBCS, and pure DBCS character strings to Unicode. A syntax suitable for specifying character data conversion from SBCS, mixed SBCS/DBCS, and pure DBCS representation to Unicode utilizes an extension to the conventional constant subtype notation. In converting the nominal value data to Unicode, currently relevant SBCS and DBCS code pages are used, as specified by three levels or scopes derived from either global options, from local AOPTIONS statement specifications, or from constant-specific modifiers. Global code page specifications apply to the entire source program. These global specifications allow a programmer to declare the source-program code page or code pages just once. These specifications then apply to all constants containing a request for conversion to Unicode. Local code page specifications apply to all subsequent source-program statements. These local specifications allow the programmer to create groups of statements containing Unicode conversion requests, all of which use the same code page or code pages for their source-character encodings. Code page specifications that apply to individual constants allow a detailed level of control over the source data encodings to be used for Unicode conversion.

"A low cost, highly accurate hand operated magnetic character recognition document reader magnetically recognizes magnetic ink (MICR) characters imprinted on documents manually conveyed past a magnetic read head. The reader incorporates the invention described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,143,355 to MacIntyre to permit relaxation of the requirement of constant document velocity. The document is manually conveyed through a defined slotted path so that the characters are scanned by a magnetic read head. The slotted path is established by a pair of substantially parallel (preferably vertical) track members and a bottom wall which is joined to, and separates, the track members by a dimension sufficient to laterally support the document, yet permits it to be conveyed along the path without substantial drag being imparted. Actual document speed is measured during the read operation by an idler member which is freely journaled and thus is drivenly rotated in response to frictional engagement with the conveyed document. The reader is capable of accurately reading the characters from the document regardless of the direction the document is moved past the read head. The compactness, low cost, high accuracy and versatility of the reader make it ideal for use in applications where a MICR reader has in the past been impractical--such as in point of sale and bank teller terminals.",1991-10-01,A,5054092,Hand-operated low cost magnetic character recognition system,1991

"Embodiments of the subject technology provide for a hybrid OCR approach which combines server and device side processing that can offset disadvantages of performing OCR solely on the server side or the device side. More specifically, the subject technology utilizes image characteristics such as glyph details and image quality measurements to opportunistically schedule OCR processing on the mobile device and/or server. In this regard, text extracted by a “faster” OCR engine (e.g., one with less latency) is displayed to a user, which is then updated by the result of a more accurate OCR engine (e.g., an OCR engine provided by the server). This approach allows factoring in additional parameters such as network latency and user preference for making scheduling decisions.

"Host multiple-byte character generator processing of guest keyboard events is blocked during applications sharing. A guest keyboard driver generates guest keyboard events which may be processed by any guest multiple-byte character generator. The guest events are transmitted to a host for use in shared applications. A patch instruction is written over a host storage queue which causes a jump to a patch subroutine when an attempt is made to deposit host keyboard events in the storage queue. Host keyboard events are marked by the patch subroutine and the marked host events are deposited in a shadow queue which is disposed in parallel with the host storage queue. Guest events also are deposited in the shadow queue. Untranslated host and single-byte character guest events, are stored in the host storage queue. When a shared application requires data from the host storage queue, the outgoing event is examined for origin, such as by examining the shadow queue. If the event is a guest event, a call is made to a host-executed applications sharing program, which in turn calls the host-multiple character generator. The call to the host multiple-byte character generator bypasses execution of the generator to preventing it from processing guest events prior to their entry into the shared application. In an embodiment of the invention, if the guest transmits a multiple-byte character to the host, the host-executed applications sharing system calls a host operating system module responsible for entering the guest multiple-byte character into a shared application. The guest multiple-byte character is entered into the shared application without a call being made to the host multiple-byte character generator.",1998-10-27,A,5828900,International multiple-byte character generator support in application sharing which distinguishes guest keyboard input from host key board and bypassing execution of the generator module when guest keyboard input is determined,1998

"A language-independent and segment free OCR system and method comprises a unique feature extraction approach which represents two dimensional data relating to OCR as one independent variable (specifically the position within a line of text in the direction of the line) so that the same CSR technology based on HMMs can be adapted in a straightforward manner to recognize optical characters. After a line finding stage, followed by a simple feature-extraction stage, the system can utilize a commercially available CSR system, with little or no modification, to perform the recognition of text by and training of the system. The whole system, including the feature extraction, training, and recognition components, are designed to be independent of the script or language of the text being recognized. The language-dependent parts of the system are confined to the lexicon and training data. Furthermore, the method of recognition does not require pre-segmentation of the data at the character and/or word levels, neither for training nor for recognition. In addition, a language model can be used to enhance system performance as an integral part of the recognition process and not as a post-process, as is commonly done with spell checking, for example.",1999-08-03,A,5933525,Language-independent and segmentation-free optical character recognition system and method,1999

"A handwriting recognition system is described that includes a language model with scoring to improve recognition accuracy, such as for words outside of a selected language model. The handwriting recognition system increases the accuracy of handwriting recognizers that perform segmentation of ink into atomic elements (segments) and then classify each ink segment separately. After segmentation, a shape classifier estimates the class (letter) probabilities for each segment of ink by producing a corresponding score. The system applies the language model scoring to the shape classification results and typically selects the class with the highest score as the recognition result. Because the language model is not too restrictive, it works well for recognizing any word, even those that would not be in a dictionary for the current language. Thus, the handwriting recognition system produces better recognition results and can often recognize words that dictionary-based language models would not recognize correctly.",2013-10-15,B2,8559723,Letter model and character bigram based language model for handwriting recognition,2013

"Pattern recognition, particularly character recognition, is effected by categorizing a cipher by a unique description using three feature sets identifying the type and location of lines which form the cipher, the location of the endpoints of each of the lines, and the location of the intersections of the lines. In the process according to the invention, lines are located by expanding or contracting the original image of the cipher to fit into a sparse space pixel matrix. The image is then thinned to define lines and so as not to obliterate lines which give the cipher its uniqueness. Once the cipher is thinned, fuzzy logic is used to ""locate"", that is, define a set of coordinates for, each line relative to an x-y coordinate system. (As each line is located, it is removed from the matrix image to facilitate locating the remaining lines.) After all the lines are located, the endpoints of each line are located and the intersect points are located. These three feature sets are encoded, resulting in three values, such as 64-bit integers.

This method preferably uses a fourth order Runge-Kutta implementation of a chaotic system. Bach's Prelude in C Major from the Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I serves as the illustrative example since it is well-known and easily accessible. Variations of the Bach can be heard that are very close to the original while others diverge further. The system is designed for composers who, having created a through-composed work or section, would like to further develop their musical material. The composer is able to interact with the system to select various versions and change them, if desired.

"An optical scanning system operates asynchronously by electro-optically detecting movement of a scanning unit directly from the data being scanned. A first embodiment of the system includes two sets of optical sensors in a hand-held unit. One set extends transversely of a scanning direction for detecting the optical pattern, and a second set is approximately aligned with the scanning direction for detecting relative movement between the pattern and the scanning unit. Relative movement is detected by detecting a pattern in a first subset of the second set of sensors and then sensing a shift of the detected pattern to a second subset of the second set of sensors. In response to detecting a unit movement, the optical states of the first set of sensor elements are polled to record a portion of the pattern along the line. This response is preferably triggered indirectly by calculating an average time interval between relative movements and periodically polling the first set of sensors at a rate set by this average interval. Upon detecting a uniform optical state of the second set of sensors, such as when scanning across a blank region in the pattern, sensing of the optical state of the first sensors continues at periodic intervals so long as the uniform state continues to be detected. The optical information is thus obtained in a succession of steps, and is assembled by the host computer. A second embodiment of the system differs from the first embodiment in that the former uses a rectangular array of imaging elements arranged in rows and columns and calculates an estimate of the instantaneous rate of relative movement.

"The invention provides an optical character reader (OCR) utilizing prioritized horizontal OR ranges for enhanced accuracy and ease of use. A light source illuminates a price tag or the like on which characters have been imprinted generally along a horizontal direction of the sheet. A lens system images the characters onto an image sensor having a field of vision covering a plurality of characters, the image sensor including a plurality of photo-electric conversion elements arranged in a matrix. A binary coding circuit digitizes outputs of the photo-electric conversion elements, which define picture elements (pixels), of an image in the field of vision of the image sensor, into binary signals representing black and white picture elements. A hand holdable scanner incorporates the light source, image sensor, lens system and binary coding circuit. An identifying circuit identifies characters from binary-coded data. The OCR utilizes at least two horizontal OR ranges in the field of vision of the image sensor. When the horizontal OR range of higher priority detects a character line, the result of character line detection is output. When none of the horizontal OR ranges detects a character line, it is determined that there is no character line. The character line detecting operation of each of the horizontal OR ranges is the same as that in the conventional OCR. However, in the OCR according to the present invention, the horizontal OR ranges are spread horizontally. Therefore, even in the case of a price tag which is long enough to have characters arranged along one of its sides, the character line or lines can be positively detected. Since at least two horizontal OR ranges are provided in the field of vision of the image sensor, therefore the pattern of the background of the price tag and the characters on the price tag can be distinguished from each other. This means that the OCR can be used for relatively small in size price tags. The OCR conserves electric power when it is not actively ""reading"" data by suspending its character identifying operations when not needed.

A character is optically scanned and converted to a rectangular matrix representation containing black and white points. The matrixed character is pre-processed by a non-iterative line-thinning technique so as to reduce the stroke width to no more than two points along the center line of the matrixed character. Isolated black points formed in the process of thinning the strokes are removed. Any gaps in the center-line of the matrixed character are filled and the edges of all long strokes are smoothed.

"Wrinkles are produced by computing directional stress, whether compression or stretching, for each pixel within each face of the mesh representing the skin, and then perturbing a surface normal based on the computed stress at each pixel in that face of the mesh. Directional stress at a given frame in an animation is determined, in general, by comparing the current state of the mesh at that frame (called a “current pose”) to the original state of the mesh (called a “rest pose”). An artist specifies a wrinkle pattern by defining a texture that is mapped to the surface, using conventional techniques. A gradient texture is created from this wrinkle texture by computing the gradient at each pixel in the wrinkle texture. For each location in a face of the surface, the vector from the gradient texture is mapped to the corresponding face of the rest pose skin model and the current pose skin model, to produce two surface vectors. These two vectors are compared to provide an estimate of the surface stress at this location in the face. A wrinkle effect may be implemented using bump mapping, but the surface normal is perturbed differently for each location in the face of the mesh based on the skin stress estimated at that location. Other effects also may be created using the estimated stresses.",2012-07-10,B2,8217955,Producing wrinkles and other effects for a computer-generated character based on surface stress,2012

"In the serializer for converting parallel data into serial data, where the parallel data comprises normal characters all of the same length and a last character of a different length, the characters are each tagged by an extra bit as it enters a FIFO. This tag bit indicates the length of the character and is shifted along with the character as the character is shifted through the FIFO. The normal character length and the length of the last character are stored. As a character emerges from the FIFO, its tag bit identifies it as a normal character or as the last character. Such tag bit is used to select the correct character length in a counter. The character is loaded in a shifter which is controlled by the counter. Therefore, the shifter is controlled by the counter to shift the correct number of times in order to shift the character into a serial bit stream. Since each character carries along with it a bit which indicates its character length, the CPU is not called upon to intervene in a time critical manner to change the character length in the counter in order to correctly control the shifting of the shifter.

"A method for operating a machine to perform unsupervised training of a set of character templates uses as the source of training samples an image source of character images, called glyphs, that need not be manually or automatically segmented or isolated prior to training. A recognition operation performed on the image source of character images produces a labeled glyph position data structure that includes, for each glyph in the image source, a glyph image position in the image source associating an estimated image location of the glyph in the image source with a character label paired with the glyph image position that indicates the character in the character set being trained. The labeled glyph position data and the image source are then used to determine sample image regions in the image source; each sample image region is large enough to contain at least a single glyph but need not be restricted in size to only contain a single glyph. The template construction process using unsegmented samples is mathematically modeled as an optimization problem that optimizes a function that represents the set of character templates being trained as an ideal image to be reconstructed to match the input image. The method produces all of the character templates substantially contemporaneously by using a novel pixel scoring technique that implements an approximation of a maximum likelihood criterion subject to a constraint on the templates produced which holds that foreground pixels in adjacently positioned character images have substantially nonoverlapping foreground pixels.

"The aesthetic characteristics of adjacent characters are used to enhance the quality of output in a proportional spacing printer and to provide right margin justification for composing. Spacing between characters is determined on the basis of the character being printed and the preceding character already printed on the page. An intercharacter displacement memory contains a list of ideal spacing for all combinations of characters to be printed.

The printer positions the print head prior to printing the next character, rather than positioning the print head after the previous character is printed. Line ending decisions for composing are eliminated during initial and final typing of a document by adding to the intercharacter displacement memory recommendations for altering the ideal spacing between characters, where aesthetically possible, to eliminate the need for line ending hyphenation.
